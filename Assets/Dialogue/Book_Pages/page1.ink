Chapter 1: The Beginning

The world started with nothing but darkness, until two deities appeared out of nowhere.

Over time the two deities fell in love, and took forms of what was dear to them, one took the form of what would later be known as a mushroom and called itself Magnaphyte and the other took the form of something unknown and called itself Bitinax. They both immediatley fell in love and wanted to create a beautiful home together. 

Magnaphyte wanted to create a physical world and filled it with water, earth, and air. Bitinax was impressed by their love and asked Magnaphyte to create metals and other minerals, in order to be able to create something they could impress them with. Bitinax called it technology. With those new materials, Bitinax decided to build a temple as a gift to Magnaphyte as an everlasting symbol of their love.
