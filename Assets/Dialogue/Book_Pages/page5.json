Bitinax wanted to place their gift in an area dear to Magnaphyte, but accidentally placed it on top of something precious to Magnaphyte. Bitinax tried desperately to apologise, but Magnaphyte was so saddened by the event that they in a fit of rage split the land in three - Bitinax on one island and Magnaphyte on another other.
