Chapter 5: Generations

Time goes on and the first &?%@!" dies. The deities, saddened by this, gives the role and gift of the &?%@!" to a new creature, thereby, making it a generational duty. 

/*However, more and more conflicts happend between the deities, resulting in a short term compromise each time. The role of the &?%@!" at this point in time have changed name to the ‘messenger’ as a result of the frequency of the conflicts, as the messenger started to spend more and more time delivering messages between the deities, than they spend time tending to the temple. */

However, Bitinax started to grow concerned for their love with the amount of conflicts, and decided to create a new gift for Magnaphyte. Unlike the temple, this gift was not meant to symbolize their love for each other, but instead Bitinax's love for Magnaphyte. Bitinax wanted to place their gift in an area dear to Magnaphyte, but accidentally placed it on top of something precious to Magnaphyte. Bitinax tried desperately to apologise, but Magnaphyte was so saddened by the event that they in a fit of rage split the land in three - Bitinax on one island and Magnaphyte on another other. Somehow the temple remained on its own separate island in the middle. Then Magnaphyte slashed the oil tanks that Bitinax had built, resulting in the oil polluting the water surrounding the newly created domain.
