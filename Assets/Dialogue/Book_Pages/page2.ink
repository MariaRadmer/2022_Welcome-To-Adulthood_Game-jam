Chapter 2: The Creation of Life

As time went on and nothing happened, the deities wanted more excitement, so they began creating small blue round things in unison. Magnaphyte gave the new creatures a physical body and the passion to live, while Bitinax gave them the ability to think logically and creatively. 

Over time, the deities wanted to teach the population of creatures different things. Magnaphyte wanted to teach them to tend to nature and that they should respect, but also fear nature. Bitinax wanted to teach them to create tools and structures. However, Magnaphyte's creations became more and more dangerous so Bitinax taught their population how to protect themselves from the dangers.

Magnaphyte became offended as they percieved it as an act of disrespect, and started to get big mad. Bitinax, not wanting their lover to hate them, apologized for their actions and wanted forgiveness, which they received.
