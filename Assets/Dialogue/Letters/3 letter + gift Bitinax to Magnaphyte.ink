MY DEAREST MAGGI,


IT IS A GIFT THAT CANNOT BE RETURNED, SORRY. SO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT, BUT PLEASE DO NOT DESTROY IT. MY LITTLE CREATURES WORKED VERY HARD ON IT. WE ALREADY HAVE A CURE FOR YOUR SPORES, BUT SOMEHOW YOU MADE THEM WORSE. I DO NOT THINK GETTING FURTHER AWAY FROM YOU WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA. THE FURTHER WE SEPERATE, THE MORE WE STRETCH THE WORLD. IT COULD MEAN SPLITTING THE WORLD APART - IT WOULD KILL EVERYONE!


LOVE, BITSY 

P.S.
I AM FINE! MY LITTLE CREATURES JUST WANTS TO KNOW HOW I LOOK LIKE ON THE INSIDE. IT IS HEALTHY CURIOUSITY.

P.P.S.
I AGREE. MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ARMS. WHAT WAS THE FORMER MESSENGER THINKING? BUT AT LEAST THEY DO THEIR JOB AND DONâ€™T READ OUR LETTERS LIKE THE FORMER ONE.
