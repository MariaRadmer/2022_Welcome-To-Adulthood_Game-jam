Oh! Hello again! How did it go? What do think of the Ancestor?

Who is the Ancestor?

#speaker:Villager #portrait:Nature_NPC_Smile #layout:left
Oh that is what we call Magnaphyte! They asked to call them that instead of their name.

#speaker:You #portrait:Player_neutral #layout:right
Why?

#speaker: Villager #portrait:Nature_NPC_neutral #layout:left
